Feature: Training for Lingo
As a Lingo Player
I want to practice guessing 5, 6 and 7 letter words
In order to be a better Lingo player.

Scenario: Start a new game of Lingo
When: I start a new game
Then: the word to guess has 5 letters
And: I should see the first letter
And: my score is 0

Scenario Outline: Start a new round
Given I am playing a game
And the round was won
And the last word had "<previous length>" letters
When I start a new round
Then the word to guess has "<next length>" letters

Examples:
     | previous length | next length |
     | 5               | 6           |
     | 6               | 7           |
     | 7               | 5           |

# Failure path
Given I am playing a game
And the round was lost
Then I cannot start a new round

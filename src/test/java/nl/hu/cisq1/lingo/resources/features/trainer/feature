Feature: Training for Lingo
As a Lingo Player
I want to practice guessing 5, 6 and 7 letter words
In order to be a better Lingo player.

Scenario: Start a new game of Lingo
When: I start a new game
Then: the word to guess has 5 letters
And: I should see the first letter
And: my score is 0

Scenario Outline: Start a new round
Given: I am playing a game
And: the round was won
And: the last word had "<previous length>" letters
When: I start a new round
Then: the word to guess has "<next length>" letters

Examples:
     | previous length | next length |
     | 5               | 6           |
     | 6               | 7           |
     | 7               | 5           |

# Failure path
Given I am playing a game
And the round was lost
Then I cannot start a new round


Scenario Outline: Guessing a word
Given: I am playing a round
And: I haven't won or lost yet
When: I try to guess "<word>"
Then: I try "<guess>"
And: I receive "<feedback>"
Then: If i haven't won or lost i continue guessing the word

Examples:
     | word             | guess         | feedback                                   |
     | BAARD            | BONJE         | CORRECT, ABSENT, ABSENT, ABSENT, ABSENT    |
     | BAARD            | BARST         | CORRECT, CORRECT, PRESENT, ABSENT, ABSENT  |
     | BAARD            | BAARD         | CORRECT, CORRECT, CORRECT, CORRECT, CORRECT|
